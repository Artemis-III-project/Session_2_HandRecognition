# Session_2_HandRecognition
Hey guys!
Im thinking to create a new branch for each session. Currently you can view and clone the working hand recognition code (working on macos sonoma 14.4, your code may need some changes for other OS's like windows/linux).

Please download and run this on VSCode, and download OpenCV and mediapipe with PIP (google how to do that if not done already). You can use google collab or other virtual environments as well, but may have to do your own little configurations.
